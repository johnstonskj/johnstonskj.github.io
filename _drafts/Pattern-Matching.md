Linda Kreger Silverman, Ph.D., an expert on giftedness, introduced the term “visual-spatial learner.” According to her, such learners have the following characteristics: 

* They understand the entire picture at once. 
* They see the complete picture before looking at the details.
* They learn quickly through visual material. 
* They don’t like a step-by-step method of learning
* Instead of thinking in words, they think in pictures. 
* They may look disorganized. 
* They find it hard to explain a step-by-step process since they view it as a whole.

There are several characteristics that define a visual-spatial learner. Visual-spatial learners:

* often have trouble with traditional teaching methods, especially step-by-step directions.
* can be an amazing analytical thinker when it comes to visual information.
* learn better with pictures or images rather than words
* learn best through hands-on activities
* often struggle with organization and taking notes
* may be more creative and outside-the-box thinkers instead of just trying to find the right answer
