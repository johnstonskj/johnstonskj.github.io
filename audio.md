When not [working](work.md) or [underwater](diving.md) I love music, both recorded and live. We 
hang out in local venues as well as travel to see live shows and festivals. We also have a pretty
big collection of recorded music as well as heavy use of [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) 
and [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/). My personal tastes range from Baroque classical to Scandinavian 
melodic death metal, although the latter tends to have more representation in t-shirt choice 
than the former. 

The following are a few recent shows; the Rammstein show was New Years eve, on the beach, to a 
small 4,000 person crowd.

After years of wishing I could afford to build a great audio setup, I started with a beautiful
Linn Sondek LP12 (with help from Definitive Audio in Bellevue, WA), which has grown over time
into the [home system](#primary-home-system)  below.

As well as the fixed systems below I have a pair of Shure 
[SE846](https://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones/se-earphones/se846-sound-isolating-earphones-state-of-the-art) 
in-ear monitors, with [Dragonfly Red](https://www.audioquest.com/dacs/dragonfly/dragonfly-red) 
for travel.

## Primary Home System

This system is setup to be seen _as well as_ heard, it has it's own room shared with all the 
CD and vinyl content. Built around the LP12 and the Akurate DSM it drives a pair of Aktiv
5140s effortlessly. The walls are covered with a lot of our show posters and other band art. 
Finally, to relax I love the Modway Remark mid-century modern love seat and chair although it
was bought mainly for the price.

## Secondary Home System

Built around my first pair of really good speakers, the amazing Linn Keilidhs, this setup has
a streamer for convenience and a nice trio of amps to drive the now-Aktiv speakers. The speaker
cables are run through the wall to have only the speakers visible in the living room.

### Home NAS

Although it's stored in the A/V closet it's network accessible by all systems.

## Work Office System

Yes, my office at work has a system in it. Well, I spend more time at my desk than I can generally 
commit to sitting in the listening room at home, so why not have good sound? While I use headphones
at home I don't want to sit for that length of time at work with cans on -- hence  speakers. 
Primarily it's using the DAC driven by my work MacBook Pro, but the clearaudio turntable is great 
when I want to chill and read/review work.

I recently swapped out an older pair of Linn Tukan bookshelf speakers for the beautiful Sonus Faber
Venere 2.0 and they have an amazing sound presence! I may be a SF convert going forward.
