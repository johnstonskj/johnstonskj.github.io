When not working I love music, both recorded and live. That involves traveling near 
and far to see bands play as well as collecting a rather nice audio system at home, 
and in my office. Musical tastes range from Baroque classical to Scandinavian melodic 
death metal, although the latter tends to have more representation in t-shirt choice 
than the former.
