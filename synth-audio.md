Along with many others I picked up a new hobby during the Covid years, and while we [are](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/life/health-wellness/2021/03/16/new-hobbies-new-connections-unexpected-joys-during-covid-19-pandemic/4664961001/) [told](https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/5/Supplement_1/14/6464869) this is good for our mental health, this particular hobby hasn't been kind to my wallet. It all started because I had a crazy idea that I was going to learn how to play a Theramin. I know, you either love them or hate them and my wife had given me a [Theramin mini kit](https://www.amazon.com/Gakken-Theremin-mini-plus/dp/4057002138) as a gift, I decided on the real thing a [moog Etherwave](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/etherwave-plus-theremin). Unfortunately, I also saw videos on using the Etherwave as a CV controller for modular synthesizers as well as running the Etherwave output through a synth for effects. 

This led to purchase #2, a [moog Grandmother](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/grandmother) _semi-modular analog synthesizer with a built-in arpeggiator, sequencer and spring reverb tank_. Add a Korg [Guitar Tuner](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZLHNM6) on the output of the Etherwave to help with learning the note distances, and I have a pretty nice setup. For a short time anyway.

After a series of rickety self-modified stands and such I saw an ad for the Output [platform](https://output.com/products/platform) studio desk and [sidecar](https://output.com/products/sidecar) cabinet. Now I have a nice (not very) little setup with a SONGMICS [Office Stool Chair](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B079PY5363) to go with the desk and a mounted LG monitor, Plugable [Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B075M1XHCK), KINESIS [Freestyle2 Ergonomic Keyboard](https://smile.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Separation/dp/B0089ZLENA), and Contour Design [Unimouse](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B075VBGNZ3) for a good computer setup.

Then, the real disaster happened. Modular Synthesizers.

For those wondering, I still can't get a good tune from the Theramin, but playing it is a whole boat-load of fun.

## Rack #1

This rack is a combination of two [Silvas modular](https://reverb.com/shop/silvas-modular-cases) 9U×112hp and 6U×112hp cases -- [MODULARGrid](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1376181) and a Intellijel powered [4U×104HP palette](https://intellijel.com/shop/cases/4u/4u-palette-eurorack-case/) case -- [MODULARGrid](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1848431). It has been through a bunch of evolution as it has grown. At the moment this has the master clock, Shakmat's [Clock O’Pawn](http://www.shakmatmodular.com/products/cop.html), as well as a whole set of randomness and rhythm generation. This is very much a generative system with 11 oscillators, 8 dedicated LFOs, 6 filters, and a bunch of modulation sources.

Note that most racks include at least one Doepfer [A-180-9](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-180-9) multicore signal connector to send signals between racks using CAT8 cables. This saves _some_ of the spaghetti of cables strung between racks that invariably becomes a hazard.

## Rack #2

[This rack](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1422030) is a pair of [Ikocase](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Ikocase) cases (6U88HP inclined and 6U×88HP vertical). Is mostly Behringer classic Moog-style design modules, 960 Sequencer, 921 VCO, 921A/921B VCO, 904A/914 VCF, 911 EG, 902 VCA, and more. Additions include an Intellijel Rubicon VCO and Quad VCA. For effects this has a Recovery Devices [Dirty Murals](https://recoveryeffects.com/collections/eurorack-modular/products/dirty-murals-eurorack-modular-device) and a Synthrotek [Echo](https://store.synthrotek.com/ECHO_Voltage_Controlled_Echo).

## Rack (MU) #3

[This rack](https://www.modulargrid.net/d/racks/view/1501553) is the bigger 5U format based on the original moog modular. The cabinets are [QCB11 Box11 Cabinets](https://shop.synthesizers.com/collections/box11-cabinets/products/qcb11) with [angled](https://shop.synthesizers.com/collections/box11-cabinets/products/copy-of-qcb11-ss-w-box11-straight-walnut-sides) and [straight](https://shop.synthesizers.com/collections/box11-cabinets/products/copy-of-qcb11-box11-cabinet-with-power-harness) walnut sides and [stacking plates](https://shop.synthesizers.com/products/qcb11-pl-box11-stacking-plates?pr_prod_strat=copurchase&pr_rec_pid=2420685078610&pr_ref_pid=2420662763602&pr_seq=uniform). Apart from the [M710](https://richsstudioproject.wpcomstaging.com/product/m710/) Sequencer and [M712](https://richsstudioproject.wpcomstaging.com/product/m712/) Sequencer Sidecar from Lower West Side Studio the rest of the modules are all from Synthesizers.com.

## Percussion Rack

The case for [this rack](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1848379) was a fun project, I had a spare [Nanuk 920](https://nanuk.com/products/nanuk-920?variant=36845685801120) waterproof hard case and the addition of a Synthrotek [case power](https://store.synthrotek.com/Case-Power_p_585.html) noise filtering distribution board, 3U power panel as well as 3U eurorack bracket ears with rails gives a nice little box. After a few different configurations I settled on using it for my percussion set. 

The core of this is the [METRON](https://wmdevices.com/collections/eurorack-modules/products/metron) sequencer, to which I've added a [Voltera](https://wmdevices.com/collections/eurorack-modules/products/voltera) expander. The voice is and a mix of Erica Synths ([Bass Drum](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/eurorack-modules/by-series/drum-series/bass-drum/), [Snare Drum](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/eurorack-modules/by-series/drum-series/snare-drum/), [Drum2](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/eurorack-modules/by-series/pico-series/pico-drum2/), and [Drums](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/eurorack-modules/by-series/pico-series/pico-drums/)) and WMD ([Crucible](https://wmdevices.com/collections/eurorack-modules/products/crucible)) percussion modules. I added a Blue Lantern [Subharmonics Generator](https://www.bluelanternstore.com/store/p1/4hp_Subharmonic_Generator_Module.html#/) for the base drum, it's a 4HP good-enough replacement for the Erica Synths Black Double Bass. I also have a Delptronics [LDB-2e](https://delptronics.com/ldb2e.php) analog drums module for a more retro sound although it gets swapped in and out as needed.

Finally, I really like the Happy Nerding [PanMix](https://happynerding.com/category/panmix/) for bringing it all together into a stereo output.

## Routing Rack

[This rack](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1848424) is built into the left-hand side of the Output platform. It currently includes a Doepfer [A-180-9 Multicore](https://doepfer.de/A1809.htm) for rack-to-rack connectivity, a pair of MST ['07 buffered multipl](https://www.synthrotek.com/products/mst-eurorack-modules/mst-07-buffered-multiple/), intended for input and output buffering. The big block is the Tesseract Modular [12X12 Buffered Matrix](https://www.tesseractmodular.com/eurorack-modules/12x12-buffered-matrix).

## Interface Rack

[This rack](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/1457228) is built into the right-hand side of the Output platform and acts as the audio interface for my MacBook Pro. The core of the interface is an Expert Sleepers [ES-9](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/es9.html) with [ESX-8GT mk3](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/esx8gt.html), [ESX-8CV mk2](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/esx8cv.html), [ES-5 mk3](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/es5.html), and [MIDI breakout](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/dm4midibreakout.html) expansions. Alongside this there are a pair of [Little Mikey](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/littlemikey.html) mic/instrument pre-amps. 

I've included the usual Doepfer [A-180-9 Multicore](https://doepfer.de/A1809.htm) for rack-to-rack connectivity, a simple [A-182-2](https://doepfer.de/a1822.htm) switch and MST ['07 buffered multipl](https://www.synthrotek.com/products/mst-eurorack-modules/mst-07-buffered-multiple/) for signal routing.
