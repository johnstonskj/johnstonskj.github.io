_In software systems, it is often the early bird that makes the worm._ — **Alan J. Perlis**

_Einstein argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature, because God is not capricious or arbitrary. No such faith comforts the software engineer_ — **Fred Brooks**

_Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words — but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures._ — **Alan J. Perlis**

_There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.  ... The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay._ — **C.A.R. Hoare**

_Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming._ — **C. A. R. Hoare**

_Some problems are better evaded than solved._ — **C. A. R. Hoare**

_Software is not limited by physics, like buildings are. It is limited by imagination, by design, by organization. In short, it is limited by properties of people, not by properties of the world._ — **Ralph Johnson**

_Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming._ — **Brian W. Kernighan**

_The lurking suspicion that something could be simplified is the world’s richest source of rewarding challenges._ — **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability._ — **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague._ — **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_I don't know how many of you have ever met Dijkstra, but you probably know that arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras_ — **Alan Kay**

_We should forget about small efficiences, say, about 97% of the time. Premature optimization is the root of all evil._ — **Donald Knuth**

_Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster._ — **Niklaus E. Wirth** (Wirth’s Law)

_... we do not consider it as good engineering practice to consume a resource lavishly just because it happens to be cheap._ — **Niklaus E. Wirth**

_Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written, and another for which it wasn’t._ — **Alan J. Perlis**

_All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection... Except for the problem of too many layers of indirection._ — **David Wheeler**

_There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors_ — ?

_Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris._ — **Larry Wall**

_It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants.  It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets._ — **Alan Cooper**

_Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning._ — **Rick Cook**

_The three most dangerous things in the world are a programmer with a soldering iron, a hardware type with a program patch and a user with an idea._ — **Rick Cook**

_Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time._ — **Terry Pratchett**
