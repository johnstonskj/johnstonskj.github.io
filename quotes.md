### Standards

_The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from._
— **Andrew S. Tannenbaum**

_Whenever a major organization develops a new system as an official standard
for X, the primary result is the widespread adoption of some simpler system as
a de facto standard for X._
— **John F. Sowa** (Sowa's Law of Standards)

## Software Architecture and Design

_There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it
so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first
method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight,
and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which
underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to
accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological
constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be
met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late. ... The price of
reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the
very rich find most hard to pay._

that it can't be done. It just means that they can't do it._
— **Anders Hejlsberg**

_...the purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic
level in which one can be absolutely precise._
— **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely
foolproof was to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools._
— **Douglas Adams**

_A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on
pedantic exactness. No magic will do._
— **Niklaus Wirth**

_Assumptions are the mother of all failures._
— **Said Ouissal**

_Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers_ and the corollary
_He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked._
— **Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet)**

_Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words — but only those to describe the
picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with
pictures._

_Truth is ever to be found in simplicity; and not in the multiplicity and
confusion of things._

same result._
— **Neal Ford**

_Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability._

understand the simplicity._

## The Art of Programming

— **Brian W. Kernighan**

_The code you write makes you a programmer. The code you delete makes you a good
one. The code you don't have to write makes you a great one._

_Oh, I’ve certainly never been short of pleasure. Do you know what real
pleasure is? A creative act. A pleasure without creativity is dead boring._
— **Gianni Agnelli**

_A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a
one-way street._
— **Doug Linder**

_The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague._
— **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_Programming requires more concentration than other activities. It’s the reason
programmers get upset about ‘quick interruptions’ – such interruptions are
tantamount to asking a juggler to keep three balls in the air and hold your
groceries at the same time._
— **Steve McConnell**

_We should forget about small efficiences, say, about 97% of the time.

— **Unknown**

_The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer
is doing until it's too late._

of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris._
— **Larry Wall**

_Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build
bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce
bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning._

— **Guy L. Steele Jr.**

_On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], "if you put
into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?"...I am not
able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such
a question._

_The greatest single programming language ever designed._
— **Alan Kay**, on Lisp

_Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a

_Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will
have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer
for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot._
— **Eric S. Raymond**

_Greenspun's Tenth Rule of Programming: any sufficiently complicated C or
Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow
implementation of half of Common Lisp._
— **Philip Greenspun**

_The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing._
— **John Powell**

_Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment._
— **Frederick "Fred" P.  Brooks**

you keep doing that over and over until you find one that does work._
— **John Backus**

_I have never let my schooling interfere with my education._
— **Mark Twain**

_You can learn more from failure than success. In failure you're forced to find
out what part did not work. But in success you can believe everything you did
was great, when in fact some parts may not have worked at all. Failure forces
you to face reality._

respect._
