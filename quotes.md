## Software Architecture and Design

_There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it
so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first
method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight,
and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which
underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to
accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological
constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be
met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late. ... The price of
reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the
very rich find most hard to pay._
— **C.A.R. "Tony" Hoare**

level in which one can be absolutely precise._
— **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

foolproof was to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools._
— **Douglas Adams**

— **Said Ouissal**

_Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers_ and the corollary
_He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked._
— **Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet)**

_Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words — but only those to describe the
picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with
pictures._
— **Alan J. Perlis**

### Simplicity

_Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler._

_The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague._
— **Edsger W. Dijkstra**

_Programming requires more concentration than other activities. It’s the reason
programmers get upset about ‘quick interruptions’ – such interruptions are
tantamount to asking a juggler to keep three balls in the air and hold your
groceries at the same time._
— **Steve McConnell**

_We should forget about small efficiences, say, about 97% of the time.

_Good programmers never write what they can steal or borrow._
— **Jeff Atwood**

_You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don't know which

bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce
bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning._
— **Rick Cook**
