Diving is something I have wanted to try off and on since I was young, unfortunately
it never seemed to be the right time. In 2014 on honeymoon I got the chance to do a 
guided dive in Bora Bora and was hooked, I loved it. It still took a year and a half 
to get myself enrolled in a class in Seattle and get certified.

I have been seriously diving now since February 2016, and convinced my wife to start in 
March. We have both certified to advanced open water and love to be in the water as much 
as we can. Although I would prefer warm water there is a pleasure in diving locally even 
if it masochistic -- dry suits are a pain!. We had the great pleasure of a wonderful
trip to Bonaire and spent a week aboard the [Bonaire from the sea](http://bonairefromthesea.org/index.html) 
AMORAY with Sue, Richard, and Rob. The diving was great, as well as finishing our
advanced certification we also complete the wreck certification on the
[Hilma Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_Hooker).

I have slowly worked up to an expensive camera setup as I found that the GoPro I was
using (HERO6, with Super Suit housing and filters) was fun as a record of the dive
and the 4K video it took could be truly spectacular, but... when people asked what we 
saw they expected pictures not hours of video. I started taking stills from the video
but they were never quite as clear as I hoped and so I skipped the smaller dive
cameras and decided to build myself a nice rig.

I do try and remember to upload dives to [Dive Logs](https://en.divelogs.de/profile/johnstonskj)
but it's not always as up to date as it should be. I use [DiveLogDT](http://www.moremobilesoftware.com/DiveLogDT/)
as my primary log, syncing from my Atomic Aquatics [Cobalt II](https://www.atomicaquatics.com/computer.html) 
computer.

Our next adventure, an [Aggressor](https://aggressor.com/) live-aboard trip to the Derawan 
Islands (Kepulauan Derawan) in Indonesia, stay tuned for a trip report.

Although, cenotes with francisco (at [Dive Life](http://divelife.mx/en/) Playa del Carmen)
comes a pretty close second.

We also dive in the cold, a lot more work but it can be really rewarding. This year we 
took part in a community clean-up dive as part of Earth Day under the docks at the 
Kirkland, WA waterfront.

Apparently at some point I took a rest...
