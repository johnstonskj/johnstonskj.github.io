I have been seriously diving now since February 2016, and convinced my wife to start in 
March. We have both certified to advanced open water and love to be in the water as much 
as we can. Although I would prefer warm water there is a pleasure in diving locally even 
if it masochistic -- dry suits are a pain!. We had the great pleasure of a wonderful
trip to Bonaire and spent a week aboard the [Bonaire from the sea](http://bonairefromthesea.org/index.html) 
AMORAY with Sue, Richard, and Rob. The diving was great, as well as finishing our
advanced certification we also complete the wreck certification on the
[Hilma Hooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_Hooker). 

I do try and remember to upload dives to [Dive Logs](https://en.divelogs.de/profile/johnstonskj)
but it's not always as up to date as it should be. I use [DiveLogDT](http://www.moremobilesoftware.com/DiveLogDT/)
as my primary log, syncing from my Atomic Aquatics [Cobalt II](https://www.atomicaquatics.com/computer.html) 
computer.

Our next adventure, an [Aggressor](https://aggressor.com/) live-aboard trip to the Derawan 
Islands (Kepulauan Derawan), stay tuned for a trip report.

Although, cenotes with francisco (at [Dive Life](http://divelife.mx/en/) Playa del Carmen)
comes a pretty close second.

We also dive in the cold, a lot more work but it can be really rewarding. This year we 
took part in a community clean-up dive as part of Earth Day under the docks at the 
Kirkland, WA waterfront.

Apparently at some point I took a rest...
