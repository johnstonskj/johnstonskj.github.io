I have had an audioquest [DragonFly Red](https://www.audioquest.com/dacs/dragonfly/dragonfly-red) for a 
while now and it is my required travel companion! Originally it powered my AKG [K550](https://www.whathifi.com/akg/k550/review) 
reference headphones that I loved for travel because I got great sound in a fold-flat(-ish) form. The
DragonFly gave so much more to the headphones that I used it for music and movies on flights and hotels. 
I swapped out the AKGs for my Shure SE846 in-ear monitors and the combination of the DragonFly and 846 
was amazing. The sound isolation from the 846, with the power and clarity of the DragonFly means I can 
listen to music or watch a movie on my iPad on an airplane with more clarity than any noise cancelling 
headphones I have heard, all while still with the iPad volume at about 30%.

So, the moment I heard audioquest was updating the DragonFly series with the new Cobalt, that $299
upgrade was a no-brainer. I have to say, of all the [audio equipment]({% link audio.md %}) I have, 
the audioquest/Shure combination is in many ways the most indispensable.
