Looking forward to Iron Maiden back in Tacoma Sp 5th 2019, a chance to look back at one 
of the best shows ever, Maiden in Madrid last year! Part of the Legacy of the Beast 
tour -- with one of the best posters -- this was a great show made even better by
[The Truants](https://thetruants.co.uk/) and the [Heavy Metal Truants](https://heavymetaltruants.com/).

Look who we met backstage, the amazing Nicko McBrain.

And yes, this had to be the best seat in the house.
