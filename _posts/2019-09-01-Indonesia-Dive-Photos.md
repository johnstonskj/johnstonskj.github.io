Some photos from the trip to the Derawan Islands. All with Sony Î±7R III in an Ikelite housing, Ikelite DS160 strobe and 
Big Blue VL3500P video light.

This was our cabin aboard the _Ocean Rover_, also known as the [Raja Ampat Aggressor](https://www.aggressor.com/rajaampatyacht.php). 
Turns out to be pretty cosy but a perfect size and man that bed felt good after a day diving!

Our first dive was under a [Bagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagan_(fishing)) which, as it turns out, is a popular 
place for juvenile Whale Sharks _Rhincodon typus_ to hang out. Unfortunately the visibility in the water was so poor it was much like a 
night dive and very few pictures came out and those that did were rich dark greens. Converting to black and white 
though really brought out the few close encounters such as this one (_taken with a Sony FE 28mm f2-22 lens and Sony 
21mm f2.8-22 ultra-wide converter using the 8" dome port; 21mm 1/50 f4.5 ISO640_).

Another whale shark, with Sandi, not great focus but I love the balance in the image. These were about 12-17 foot 
juveniles, big enough when they appeared right next to you out of the gloom (_21mm 1/60 f4.5 ISO640_).

Not long after we entered this dive we swam past this Green Turtle _Chelonia mydas_, it was a natural ledge on the side of the reef and he seemed 
to be just watching the world go by. You can still see the amount of particles in the water which made a lot of pictures 
a challenge (_taken with a Sony E 30mm F3.5 prime macro using the macro port, not a perfect choice but again I like the 
composition of the subject; 1/60 ISO640_).

I love to capture the coral details, they do have the advantage of not moving quite as much as the fish and other 
critters, but the diversity, the colors and the detail are fascinating (_macro 1/250 ISO640_).

This little group of fish though were very cooperative and the little bright yellow flashes from the pair of Bluestreak 
Cleaner Wrasse _Labroides dimidiatus_ made the picture fun for 
me (_macro 1/250 ISO640_).

More coral, these had a wonderful texture to them, the slightly more pink right hand side is probably the Big Blue light 
which I need to spend some more time with (_macro 1/250 f4 ISO640_).

A mix of hard and soft corals, but the white one looked so much like a chrysanthemum firework it seems to give the 
picture a sense of motion (_macro 1/250 f4 ISO640_).

One of my favorite images of the whole trip, a fan under an overhang. The DS160 strobe on the right and the VL3500P on 
the right actually picked out the colors perfectly. I haven't tried to remove any of the backscatter at all, maybe one 
day (_macro 1/250 f4 ISO320_).

Anemone fish are crazy! These little suckers are always on the move and anyone that gets that perfect photo of one in its 
anemone home deserves a drink. This wasn't the usual Clown Anemonefish but a Pink Anemonefish _Amphiprion perideraion_
(_macro 1/250 f4 ISO320_).

Obviously, there's a **lot** more, but those are a few favorites.
