Recently I stumbled over an article, wonderfully titled
[_A Raspberry Pi (VAX) Cluster_](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/a-raspberry-pi-vax-cluster).
Well, as someone that developed on VAX for a while, actually had a Micro VAX II
in their garage for a period of time, AND keeps OpenVMS manuals downstairs,
I just *had* to go read. 

I have to say, as someone who stared through the glass at big iron machines, it
is not only incredible that we can now emulate these monsters on such small and
inexpensive hardware, but we can even show them running in networked configurations.

I donated my last VAX hardware (VAXStation 4000/60) as well as a Next Cube to 
the [Living Computers Museum](https://livingcomputers.org/) in 2018. It seems 
important to preserve as much as we can from an industry that moves so fast 
and which has seen much of it's output thrown away as it becomes obsolete.

All computers in the collection in it's prime were named for Terry Pratchett's
witches.
