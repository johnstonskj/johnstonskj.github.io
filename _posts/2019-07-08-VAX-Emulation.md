title: VAX Emulation

Recently I stumbled over an article, wonderfully titled
[_A Raspberry Pi (VAX) Cluster_](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/a-raspberry-pi-vax-cluster).
Well, as someone that developed on VAX for a while, actually had a Micro VAX II
in their garage for a period of time, AND keeps OpenVMS manuals downstairs, well
I had to go read. 

I have to say, as someone who stared through the glass at big iron machines it
is not only incredible that we can now emulate these monsters on such small and
inexpensive hardware, but we can even show them running in networked configurations.

Having donated my last VAX hardware (VAXStation 3000) as well as a Next Cube to 
the [Living Computers Museam](https://livingcomputers.org/) it is important to
preserve as much as we can from an industry that moves so fast and which has 
seen much of it's output thrown away as it becomes obsolete.
