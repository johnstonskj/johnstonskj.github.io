I know I haven't posted recently, so first of all here is an update on diving trips since September last year.

1. September 20th, 2020 -- Redondo Beach in Seattle.
1. October 4th - 25th, 2020 -- Playa del Carmen, including David's Hole, Cenote Tajma Ha, and Cenote Car Wash.
1. February 2nd, 2021 -- Redondo Beach in Seattle.
1. March 8th - 22nd Playa del Carmen.
1. May 2nd, 2021 -- Redondo Beach in Seattle.
1. May 11th -- Junkyard in Seattle.
1. June 13th - 17th -- Belize, including the Great Blue Hole.

The Belize trip was fantastic, staying at the deservedly famous [Ramon's Village Resort](https://ramons.com/). The
boats were great, even in the uncharacteristically rough seas, guides and crew were fantastic. While the 
[Great Blue Hole](https://belize.com/belize-blue-hole/) is one of those things all divers want to check-off their
list, the [Half Moon Caye Wall](https://www.divessi.com/uk/mydiveguide/divesite/63131) and
[The Aquarium at Long Caye](https://www.divessi.com/en/mydiveguide/divesite/18103) were some of the most spectacular
diving we've seen. 

One of the most memorable moments was a [group of six dolphins](https://youtu.be/1q-H6vFMAZM) that decided to come 
down and play around us for a while.
