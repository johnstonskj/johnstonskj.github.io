Amazon is the first company I have worked for where mentoring is not just an
expectation but where conversations with managers regarding other engineers
may include the phrase *who's their mentor?*. Mentoring is a rewarding part of
the job, and I have benefited from mentoring from some amazing individuals
both technical and non-technical. In recent years a *sponsorship* program has
been started and I have been asked a few times the difference between these
two rôles. I remember this paragraph from the article [What’s the Difference
between Sponsorship and
Mentorship?](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2022/07/whats-the-difference-between-sponsorship-and-mentorship/)
from the [ABA Banking Journal](https://bankingjournal.aba.com).

> A mentor is a person who gives a protégé advice, answers questions,
> strategizes career moves and professional development. A sponsor is someone
> who promotes a protégé to other people to help advance the protégé’s career.
> A pithy way to remember the distinction is this: “Mentors talk to you.
> Sponsors talk about you to powerful people when you aren’t in the room.”

I stole this, added another person to this mix and made it even more pithy!

> Managers talk *at* you,
> Mentors talk *with* you,
> Sponsors speak *for* you.

As with all good pithy sayings this one grossly over-simplifies and doesn't
admit that actually there is a spectrum of interactions, goals, skills, and
interests wrapped up in these different rôles. Managers have specific
responsibilities but are also generally rewarded for the growth of their
employees and so some level of mentoring advice can be expected from your
manager. On the other hand, it may be that your manager doesn't have a
background in your discipline, or sees a specific need that an external mentor
can help with. Mentoring is an informal process and has to work for both
mentor and mentee but in general the scope is negotiated between both.

Your manager's primary responsibility however is to set goals for their team
and to direct you effectively to meet those goals. This is the **at** part,
directing is not usually a democratic process and while consultation is good
in the setting of realistic goals, it's their head on the block if you miss.

Your mentor can sit and talk **with** you about any topics you agree; your
need may not be the strength of a chosen mentor and they may direct you
elsewhere (which in turn expands your network). Beyond this though the
discussion may be on areas of knowledge or specific skills you feel you need
to improve, or other soft skills (or behaviors). It is rare for example for
students to be taught negotiation and collaboration techniques at school but
we all know how important it is to be able to compromise, disagree and commit,
when it comes to teamwork. Mentor meetings tend to be
informal, coffee chats for example which allows for discussions around the
edge of your scope.

Your sponsor is another more formal relationship and one which more often is
assigned to support you. A sponsor may talk with you about your career
aspirations and the steps you see along the way. However, the real value of a
sponsor is the talking they do **about** you in putting your name forward for
projects and positions that they feel you would be suited for but may not have
the exposure to. From [Mentorship & Sponsorship: Why you need
both](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mentorship-sponsorship-why-you-need-both-chantal-brine/)
published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

> The critical difference in a sponsorship relationship versus mentorship, is
> the dynamic of a position of influence, or authority. A person can only
> truly be a sponsor if they are able to create an opportunity for you that
> you otherwise would not be able to access on your own. Your sponsor not only

One behavior often needed of mentors, and managers, is to listen to the
frustrations and insecurities of your mentee. Bordering on therapy some days
your position as a trusted ear allows a mentee in particular to open up about
the non-technical issues that they may feel hold them back. In some cases this
may spark a conversation about coping behaviors, in others you may be in a
position to point out the problem to others or fix it yourself, and in some
it's an opening to discuss whether they may need a change in team or rôle.

The combination of the guidance from these different points of view, and
potentially different supporters, it looks very much like the description of
an apprenticeship -- "*Apprenticeship is a system for training a new
generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training
and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading)*" --
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship). Consider the
following from [Understanding The Apprentice
Journey](https://www.mtdtraining.com/blog/understanding-apprentice-journey.htm)
by Management Training Specialists (MTD).

> Each apprenticeship standard is made up of knowledge, skills and behaviours.
> 
> **The Knowledge** -- during the apprenticeship you will acquire the facts, 
> information, theory and technical information of the subject required to 
> enable you to be effective in their [sic] rôle.
> 
> **The Skills** –- the expertise, practical skills and talent needed in order 
> to do a job, or task. The Job skills allow you to do a specific job.
> 
> **Behaviours** –- these are the way you act, approach activities and work with 
> others and support you to be effective in your rôle and future career.

The missing piece in the description above is the sponsor rôle of advocating
for and putting forward the apprentice for new opportunities. However, it is
clear that all of these rôles are performing aspects of the set of support
activities and you should take advantage of all that you have access to.
