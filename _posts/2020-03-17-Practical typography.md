For anyone not wanting to read one of my favorite books, [The Elements of Typographic 
Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Version-Anniversary/dp/0881792128) by Robert Bringhurst, I 
would definitely recommend [_Butterick's Practical Typography 2nd Edition_](https://practicaltypography.com/)

If you want the poster form for your wall, [_Summary of key rules_](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html)
is a definite candidate.
