Just a few photos from a quick trip down to Florida to dive along the key. Actually got a really good batch of pictures
from this trip, even with a flooded strobe on the very first dive. All with Sony Î±7R III in an Ikelite housing.

This was a nice shot of some anemone on the structure of the 
[Vandenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_General_Hoyt_S._Vandenberg_(T-AGM-10)) wreck off Key West. There
was a lot of particles in the water, and while a great and fun pair of dives, not so many pictures (_Sony FE 28-70mm 
F3.5-5.6 OSS at 35mm 1/60 f6.3 ISO640_).

I love the lighting on this one, the film speed may have been too low, but I like it. Mostly French Grunts
_Haemulon flavolineatum_ with a lone Brown Chromis _Chromis multilineata_ in the foreground (_Sony E 30mm F3.5 macro 
at 1/160 f/4 ISO125_).

You see these a lot, Spotlight Parrotfish _Sparisoma viride_, this is a mature form, the younger forms are quite 
different. Not really got a picture that seemed to capture the colors before (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO200_).

Just a fun one, an odd bunch; three different colors of Ocean Surgeonfish _Acanthurus bahianus_, and something 
silvery in the back (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO250_).

This Spotfin Butterflyfish _Chaetodon ocellatus_ was going around and around the corals in the background and pretty 
close up for a while (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO100_).

_We're not here, you can't see us behind this tree_; I liked the balance and movement in this one. French Grunts
again with the all yellow tails and Bluestriped Grunt _Haemulon sciurus_ with the black on 
their tails (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO125_).

Now try and tell me this isn't the derpy-est looking fish, the Blue Parrotfish _Scarus coeruleus_ (_macro 1/160 f4 
ISO125_).

The vibrancy of the blue spots on this Scrawled Filefish _Aluterus scriptus_ was so cool (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO100_).

Nurse sharks _Ginglymostoma cirratum_ are usually hanging out in caves or under overhangs during the day. This one 
decided it had had enough attention and swam lazily out from its sleeping spot (_macro 1/250 f4.5 ISO250_).

A Great Barracuda _Sphyraena barracuda_ on the reef, I love taking pictures of these as they love to just hang in the 
water and you can usually get pretty close. You can see the movements in the fans around this one as it stayed 
motionless (_macro 1/200 f4.5 ISO200_).
