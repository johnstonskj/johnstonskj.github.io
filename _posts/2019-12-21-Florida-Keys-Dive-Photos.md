Just a few photos from a quick trip down to Florida to dive along the key. Actually got a really good batch of pictures
from this trip, even with a flooded strobe on the very first dive. 

This was a nice shot of some anemone on the structure of the 
[Vandenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_General_Hoyt_S._Vandenberg_(T-AGM-10)) wreck off Key West. There
was a lot of particles in the water, and while a great and fun pair of dives, not so many pictures (_Sony FE 28-70mm F3.5-5.6 OSS at 35mm 1/60 f6.3 ISO640_).

I love the lighting on this one, the film speed may have been too low, but I like it (_Sony E 30mm F3.5 macro at 1/160 f/4 ISO125_).

You see these a lot, Spotlight Parrotfish, this is a mature form, the younger forms are quite different. Not really got a picture that seemed to capture the colors before (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO200_).

Just a fun one, an odd bunch (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO250_).

This Spotfin Butterflyfish was going around and around the corals in the background and pretty close up for a while (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO100_).

_We're not here, you can't see us behind this tree_; I liked the balance and movement in this (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO125_).

Now try and tell me this isn't the derpy-est looking fish, the Blue Parrotfish _Scarus coeruleus_ (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO125_).

The vibrancy of the blue spots on this Scrawled Filefish was so cool (_macro 1/160 f4 ISO100_).

Nurse sharks are usually hanging out in caves or under overhangs during the day. This one decided it had had enough 
attention and swam lazily out from its sleeping spot (_macro 1/250 f4.5 ISO250_).

A Barracuda on the reef, I love taking these guys picture, they love to just hang in the water and you can usually
get pretty close. You can see the movements in the fans around this one as it stayed motionless (_macro 1/200 f4.5 ISO200_).
