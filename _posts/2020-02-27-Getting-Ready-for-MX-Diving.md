Starting to think about the camera setup to take with us to Mexico in a few weeks. We'll be mostly diving around [Isla Mujeres](http://www.isla-mujeres.net/) but also a day doing cenotes as well. Adding to the Sony FE 28mm f/2-22 and Sony 21mm f/2.8-22 Ultra Wide Converter combination I have used for wide-angle in the past I may add the Sony 16mm f/3.5-22 Fisheye Converter that fits the same 28mm lens and would be really fun for the MUSA statues. The pair of Ikelite DS-160  gives a lot of light along with a pair of Big Blue constant lights we should be set for most conditions. The cenotes will be a fun experience, it'll be the first time I have taken a decent camera there; the last time I did manage to get some nice stills from a GoPro video but they still lacked detail. Both the UWC and fish-eye will give me so much better light capture hopefullt to get the amazing effects through the dark water!

For macro though I am going to replace the Sony 30mm f/3.5 I used on the last few trips with a new Sony FE 90mm F/2.8 Macro G OSS which gives me a full-frame lens and a better minimum working distance (from 9.75cm to 28cm) allowing the same shots without having to get on top of the subject (given that about 1-1.5cm are used up in the housing). I am also adding a Weefine 3000 ring lens that will screw onto the 67mm ring on the front of the Ikelite flat port. 

Will post pictures when I have them :)
