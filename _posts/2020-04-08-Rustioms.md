I started, what I thought would be a relatively short, page on our internal wiki about things I appreciated having 
worked with Rust for a while. It started with a co-worker's excellent presentation to teams on our experience building 
a [prototype in rust]({% post_url 2019-11-11-More-Almost-Real-Rust %}), which I felt I should contribute to as he credited 
me with some of the work. I coined the term "Rustiom" as a contraction of "Rust Idiom", or something that sounded 
more technical than "Rustism". The goal is to deal with [idioms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiom) in
the way that [Rustaceans](https://www.rustaceans.org/) write code as well as just cool things in the language and 
libraries.

This was the introduction to the work version.

Rather than the over sized single page my plan here is to break it into a series of posts and try and tackle related 
topics rather than as the original sort of stream of "_oh yeah, and then there's this!_". To kick off the series, below 
are the documentation and article links I find useful and my curated set of go-to crates.

## The Usual List of Links

1. [Rust Language Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/) 
1. [The Rust Programming Language (Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
1. [Standard Library Documentation](https://std.rs/)
1. [3rd Party Libraries for Rust](https://crates.io/)
1. [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)

These are other pages and articles I have either read more than once or forwarded to others for some reason.

1. [Rust Design Patterns (unofficial)](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns)
1. [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)
1. [Idiomatic Rust; Guidelines for writing elegant Rust programs](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust)
1. [Elegant Library APIs in Rust](https://deterministic.space/elegant-apis-in-rust.html) (from [[Pascal's Scribbles](https://deterministic.space/))

## My List of Useful Crates

These seem to be the most commonly used across the projects I've worked on so far.

* [**criterion**](https://crates.io/crates/criterion); Statistics-driven micro-benchmarking library
* [**lazy_static**](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static); A macro for declaring lazily evaluated statics in Rust.
* [**log**](https://crates.io/crates/log); A lightweight logging facade for Rust; this is the log sending portion, you'll 
  need another crate to actually capture, format and output the log.
  * [**env_logger**](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) is a simple and common log capture crate, good for services or 
    interactive tools. I prefer [**flexi_logger**](https://docs.rs/flexi_logger/0.15.2/flexi_logger/) these days over 
    env_logger.
  * [**pretty_logger**](https://crates.io/crates/pretty_env_logger) is a nice approach using logging interactively, not so 
    much for services. [**fern**](https://crates.io/crates/fern) is a nice configurable capture crate although I've not 
    tried it. 
  * [**tracing**](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) (facade) and [**tracing-subscriber**](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-subscriber) 
    (capture) are a very high-performance approach that also supports spans, timing and more, but very service oriented.
* [**num**](https://crates.io/crates/num); A collection of numeric types and traits for Rust, including bigint, complex, 
  rational, range iterators, generic integers, and more!
* [**pest**](https://crates.io/crates/pest); (with [**pest_derive**](https://crates.io/crates/pest_derive), and maybe 
  [**pest_consume**](https://crates.io/crates/pest_consume)) a parser library using PEGs.
* [**proptest**](https://crates.io/crates/proptest); Proptest is a property testing framework (i.e., the QuickCheck family) 
  inspired by the Hypothesis framework for Python.
* [**regex**](https://crates.io/crates/regex); An implementation of regular expressions for Rust. This implementation uses 
  finite automata and guarantees linear time matching on all inputs.
* [**serde**](https://crates.io/crates/serde); Serde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures 
  efficiently and generically. 
* [**structopt**](https://crates.io/crates/structopt); Parse command line argument by defining a struct. More ergonomic 
  than [**clap**](https://crates.io/crates/clap).
* [**tokio**](https://crates.io/crates/tokio); An event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous I/O 
  backed applications. 
  * There are a number of frameworks for building services and web apps, it's worth a read of 
    [_Rust web framework comparison_](https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison).
* [**toml**](https://crates.io/crates/toml); A native Rust encoder and decoder of TOML-formatted files and streams.
