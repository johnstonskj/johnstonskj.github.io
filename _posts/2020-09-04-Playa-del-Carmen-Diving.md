Unfortunately Covid-19 put a stop to our planned [trip to Mexico]({% link _collection/2020-02-27-Getting-Ready-for-MX-Diving.md %})
for spring break. We managed to make a safe trip to Playa del Carmen in August though. It's certainly an interesting
experience to travel these days, we were lucky in that all the airports we traveled through were pretty quiet and so
distancing was easy. We spent the time there diving as much as possible, both reef and Cenote.
