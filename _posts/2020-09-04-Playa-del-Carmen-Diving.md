Unfortunately Covid-19 put a stop to our planned [trip to Mexico]({% link _posts/2020-02-27-Getting-Ready-for-MX-Diving.md %})
for spring break. We managed to make a safe trip to Playa del Carmen in August though. It's certainly 
an interesting experience to travel these days, we were lucky in that all the airports we traveled 
through were pretty quiet and so distancing was easy. We spent the time there diving as much as possible, 
both reef and Cenote.

Once we decided to go, I decided to use the opportunity to learn to use the xDeep/Hollis sidemount rig
with a good instructor and in warm water not cold. I had managed to buy a great BC right before the 
world shut down, great timing, but now I get to try it out. I bought an xDeep 
[Stealth 2.0 Rec](https://www.xdeep.eu/sidemount-bc-wing-stealth-tec-pr-106.html) and added a pair of
[Hollis](https://www.hollis.com/product-category/regulators/) DC1/212 primary/secondary regulators; 
these are an older style, were used, but I had them serviced, and they work like new. Having added Hollis 
SPGs, xDeep cargo pouch, xDeep tank cam-bands, and some custom tri-glides from Sump UK it seemed
about time to get it all wet!.

We didn't really have a plan, so the following schedule is more of a retrospective.

For Friday dives fran picked two reasonably sedate cenotes to practice getting gear on and off in the 
water, trim, and gas management. It's pretty different, but remarkably it doesn't take long to get
used to it!.

first time underwater.
