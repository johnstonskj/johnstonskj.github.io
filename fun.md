At work the major platform is the JVM, I say that rather than Java because
there is most definitely a growing trend away from Java to achieve better
individual and team productivity. Scala has played a role in this but it
appears that the current leading choice is now Kotlin, which I have to say
I do like a lot. Additionally there is interest in non-JVM languages with
Go and Rust being the two front runners. 

At home, [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is my favorite small tool language.

## Programming Languages I Have Known

Yes, I collect these things; I am fascinated by the different approaches that 
languages take, the evolution among language families, and the specialization
and generalization they support. I also periodically scan eBay and others for
manuals and books for the more obscure or fossilized languages. Unfortunately
some of these only exist as online, usually PDF, scanned manuals.
