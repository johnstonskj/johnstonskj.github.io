Welcome to my first real attempt at a collection of personal things. 

Please excuse the TBDs sprinkled through the site as I add content.

Mostly, I'll keep track of interesting things I am working on -- I am a 
software geek @ Amazon during the day ([work stuff](work.md)), or having 
fun with -- I also code for fun ([fun stuff](fun.md)) at other times. I
am coming to terms with the use of markdown for GitHub, but wherever
possible I write with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (and really 
like [texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) for the Mac).

My work environment is predominantly primarily [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) 
with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), although Amazon systems run on 
[Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) and I have an 
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) machine at home for Machine Learning 
development. I keep the development environment across these machines 
approximately in sync using a [dotfiles](https://github.com/johnstonskj/dotfiles)
repository in GitHub.

With my wife I love to [SCUBA dive](diving.md) and love music, especially
live. I might also be considered an [audiophile](audio.md) at home.
