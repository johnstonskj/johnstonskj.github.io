Welcome to my first real attempt at a collection of personal things. 

Mostly, I'll keep track of interesting things I am working on -- I am a 
software geek @ Amazon during the day ([work stuff]({% link work.md %})), or having 
fun with code ([fun stuff]({% link fun.md %})) at other times. My work environment 
is predominantly primarily [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) with 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), although Amazon systems run on 
[Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) and I have an 
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) machine at home for Machine Learning 
development. 

I am coming to terms with the use of markdown for GitHub -- and therefore
pages -- but wherever possible I write with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) 
and really like [texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) for the Mac.

With my wife I love to [SCUBA dive]({% link diving.md %}), in warm and cold water. 
We have been lucky to make some amazing friends and visit some incredible
places over the last few years together.

I also share with her a love of music, especially live. I might also be 
considered an [audiophile]({% link audio.md %}) at home.

I use [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) for secure email, you can find more
details on my keys [here](/pgp-keys).

Thanks.
